<p>On Aug 11th, A flight of <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/airline/Hainan%20Airlines">Hainan Airlines</a>, HU7148, a <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/aircraft/a320">Airbus A330-200</a>, encountered severe turbulence during the flight from Chengdu airport to Beijing, China, the plane was jolted twice and descending through about 4200 meters, The crew continued for a safe landing in Beijing about 17 minutes later, but the incident still caused total 30 Chinese passengers and crew members injured.</p>

<h2 id="Terrifying_Experience">Terrifying Experience</h2><p><img src="http://www.safetyflights.com/images/flightBlog/U10856P1T1D32191918F23DT20150811184004.jpg" alt="Damaged Cabin Photo: Weibo"></p>
<p>“It was the strongest shaking I have ever had in my life. I see people behind me having their heads knocked. The blood and sobs really scared me “, One passenger posted on weibo.</p>
<p>“I was thrown upwards and hit the ceiling before I had the time to fasten my seatbelt”, another passenger wrote.</p>
<p>Some injuries, surprisingly, are simply from the reason that people not belted into their seats! They were lifted off and impacted the ceiling of the aircraft before coming down again, like the passengers wrote above.</p>
<h2 id="Keep_Your_Seat_Belt_Fastened">Keep Your Seat Belt Fastened</h2><p>Turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to airline passengers and flight attendants in non-fatal plane accidents according to <a href="https://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_safe/turbulence/" target="_blank" rel="external">FAA website</a>. The turbulence that HU7148 experienced was an in-flight turbulence, which happens very often.</p>
<p>Today, even the best airplane can not 100% detect clear-air turbulence, especially mountain wave turbulence, which is formed by specific air flows around the mountains. So keep in mind to keep your seat belts fastened during the flight! You will never know what will happen in next second.</p>

<p>On Thursday,  Malaysian PWrime Minister confirmed that plane debris found on the Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean belongs to missing Flight MH370. It is a great breakthrough in solving one of aviation’s greatest mysteries.</p>
<p>In the statement, Malaysian Prime Minister said “Today, 515 days since the plane disappeared, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you that an international team of experts have conclusively confirmed that the aircraft debris found on Reunion Island is indeed from MH370,”<br><a id="more"></a> </p>
<h2 id="What_We_Need_to_Do_Next">What We Need to Do Next</h2><p><img src="http://www.safetyflights.com/images/flightBlog/CurrentsMH370.gif" alt="Indian Ocean Drift"><br>According to this map, we can find sea currents were pushing the wing part almost 4000 kilometres from previous seach area. It will become very hard for searching team to continue their work in previous area. Since there were no further wreckage found on the island, we can guess that the entire plane was submerged in the ocean. However, MH370 is an important alerm that make people and airline to think more about flight safety. In the MH370’s accident, Malaysian Airline’s pool management is the main cause. If we want less flight accidents appear in the furture, the only thing we need to do is spending more time and money on flight safety and improving management, not cheap ticket.</p>

<h2 id="Is_the_Boeing_777_aricraft_safe?">Is the Boeing 777 aricraft safe?</h2><p>In the last week, accident investigators determined the piece of wreckage found on shore in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island, was part of a Boeing 777 aircraft, which may belong to the missing Malaysia Airline Flight MH370. While this unexpected news brings up the hope finding the ultimate reason of this mysterious air crash, it also brings out the question to us again - How safe Boeing 777, as the most famous aircraft type in the world could be? In the past year, Boeing 777 had two world-awakening flight accidents which caused hundreds of people lost their lives. One of which, the missing MH370, has became the recent world’s greatest aviation mystery. We have no idea how and where this Boeing 777 disappeared in the Indian Ocean. However, even after these two deadly accidents, Boeing 777’s aviation record is still among the best in aviation history.<br><a id="more"></a> </p>
<h3 id="13_Flight_Accidents_of_Boeing_777">13 Flight Accidents of Boeing 777</h3><p>In <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/">Safe Flights</a>‘ database,ever since Boeing 777  entered service in June 1995, there have been <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/aircraft/Boeing%20777"><strong>13</strong></a>  accidents of Boeing 777, 5 of them have led to the total destruction of the aircraft, and MH370 is the only one of this type has vanished over the sea.</p>
<p>The first Boeing 777 hull loss was a British Airways jet on January 17, 2008 which landed 1,000 feet short of the runway. The fuel-oil heat exchanger of its engines are clogged by ice crystals in the fuel.</p>
<p>The second hull loss was in July 2011 when an Egypt Air jet caught fire at Cairo international Airport. The electrical fault or short circuit in oxygen system was the reason caused the fire.</p>
<p>The third was in July 2013 when a Boeing 777 of Asiana Airways crashed at San Francisco International Airport. Its landing gear and tail struck the seawall of San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>The last two were MH370 and MH17. MH17 was shot down over the Russian Ukrainian border in July 2014.</p>

<p>According to a chart published by Boeing in its <a href="http://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/company/about_bca/pdf/statsum.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">airline accidents report</a>, Boeing 777 was the safest wide-body commercial airliner in longtime service before any fatal accident. It only has 0.29 total hull loss per million departures. Today’s 777 operators still enjoy a 99.3 percent dispatch reliability rate, which Boeing calls “the highest amongst all twin-aisle airplanes in service today.”</p>

<h2 id="What_Causes_Boeing_747_Cargo_Crashed_in_Afghanistan?">What Causes Boeing 747 Cargo Crashed in Afghanistan?</h2><p>On April the 29th in 2013, a tragical flight accident had occurred in Afghanistan. A <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/aircraft/Boeing%20747-428BCF"><strong>Boeing 747-400BCF</strong></a> cargo plane lost its control and crashed when taking off from Bagram Air Base. Seven crew members in the plane got killed immediately. This plane is operated by National Air Cargo.</p>

<h3 id="119_Flight_Accidents_of_Boeing_747">119 Flight Accidents of Boeing 747</h3><p>In <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/">Safe Flights</a>‘s database, there are <a href="http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/aircraft/Boeing%20747"><strong>120</strong></a> accidents in record during the last ten years for Boeing 747 aircraft, and 3 of them are serious accidents with fatalities, which were all caused by loss of control. However, considering the fact that there are more than 1000 Boeing 747 currently busy in service, 3 is still a safe number.</p>
<h3 id="Improperly_Restrained_Cargo_Caused_Boeing_747_Crash">Improperly Restrained Cargo Caused Boeing 747 Crash</h3><p>People may wonder why plane in this safe kind would crash in such a shocking way. According to the NTSB(National Transportation Safety Board), this plane was carrying five mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles, the crash occurred when at least one of the vehicles broke loose and moving very quickly toward the rear end during the takeoff, the key hydraulic systems were damaged and the horizontal stabilizer components failed to make response to the balance change, which made the freighter impossible to take control.</p>
<h3 id="How_Heavy_is_the_MRAP">How Heavy is the MRAP</h3><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/FPCougar.jpg/1024px-FPCougar.jpg" alt="MRAP"><br>Mine-Resistant Ambush-Rrotected (MRAP) vehicles are for military use and very heavy comparing with other regular cars. It weights close to 18 tons each. MRAP is designed for protecting the cars from improvised explosive device (IED) attack. A variant of the Humvee’s IED defeating Frag Kit 6 armor were installed on each vehicle, so when it is shifting so quickly in the plane, almost nothing can be done to handle the situation.</p>
<h3 id="Safe_Flights’s_quote">Safe Flights’s quote</h3><p>A lot of times, severe flight accidents were caused not by the quality of the aircraft, but the airline management or  unexpected situation such as this boeing 747 crash. </p>
