If you have a fear of flying, you are not alone. Did you know that at least one out of every six adults are afraid to fly? Actually, even 35 percent of all airline crews, flight attendants and poliots have fear of flying, too. But we will help you to overcome the fear by following these five steps.

## 1. Recognise the source of the fear

We know that you are afraid of falling! When you are so up on high in the air, It’s natural to think you may fall because we are so used to stand on something solid, let us tell you something to start off, air travel is actually the second-safest mode of mass transportation in the world, only second to the escalator and elevator. Your chances of being involved in an aircraft accident are approximately 1 in 11 million. Your chances of being killed in an automobile accident are 1 in 5000, so the most dangerous part of your flight will actually be the drive to the airport, funny right?

## 2. Board a airplane with knowledge

People will get terrified when they don’t know what they are dealing with - another human nature, so don’t be ashamed if you do. When it comes to the air travel, if you are not familiar with how the airplane works, such as why it can fly in the sky? why it sometimes vibrates heavily, and what is the  noise inside the plane… you will get anxious pretty quickly about some situations which are actually normal .. so do some research at home, or when you are waiting for the boarding, it will make your trip less worried.

## 3. Choose a safer airline

It is important to choose a safe airline even you have no fear of flying. The definition of a safe airline majorly consists of - Advanced airplane model, and solid company operation. Therefor airline’s accidents record will be the best reference for you. A safe airline like Qatar Airways, which only has 5 aviation accidents throughout  the history( *Link* [**Aviation Accidents Records of Qatar**](http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/airline/Qatar%20Airways)), ), means they manage their planes and services really well.
