## Is the Boeing 777 aricraft safe? 
In the last week, accident investigators determined the piece of wreckage found on shore in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island, was part of a Boeing 777 aircraft, which may belong to the missing Malaysia Airline Flight MH370. While this unexpected news brings up the hope finding the ultimate reason of this mysterious air crash, it also brings out the question to us again - How safe Boeing 777, as the most famous aircraft type in the world could be? In the past year, Boeing 777 had two world-awakening flight accidents which caused hundreds of people lost their lives. One of which, the missing MH370, has became the recent world’s greatest aviation mystery. We have no idea how and where this Boeing 777 disappeared in the Indian Ocean. However, even after these two deadly accidents, Boeing 777’s aviation record is still among the best in aviation history.
