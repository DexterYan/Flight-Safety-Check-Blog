###Improperly Restrained Cargo Caused Boeing 747 Crash
People may wonder why this kind of safer plane crashed in a such shocking way. The reason is actually quite simple. According to the NTSB, the crash occurred when at least one of the mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles moved toward the rear during takeoff, damaging key hydraulic systems and horizontal stabilizer components, making the freighter impossible to control. This plane had been carrying five MRAP vechicles. If one of vechicles broke loose and shifting very quickly, it will let the stabilizer fail to make response to the balance change.

### How Heavy is the MRAP

Mine-Resistant Ambush-Rrotected (MRAP) vehicles is very heavy compared with other vechicles. Its weight is close to 18 tons. MRAP is designed for protect the cars from improvised explosive device (LED) attrack. The military installed a variant of the Humvee's IED defeating Frag Kit 6 armor in MRAP. When it is shifting very quickly in the plane, even Boeing 747 and pilot can not handle it in few minuties.
