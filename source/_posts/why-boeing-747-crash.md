### 119 Flight Accidents of Boeing 747

In [Flight Safety Check](http://www.safetyflights.com/)'s database, there are [**120**](http://www.safetyflights.com/#!/search/aircraft/Boeing%20747) accidents in record during the last ten years for Boeing 747 aircraft, and 3 of them are serious accidents with fatalities, which were all caused by loss of control. However, considering the fact that there are more than 1000 Boeing 747 currently busy in service, 3 is still a safe number.

### Improperly Restrained Cargo Caused Boeing 747 Crash
People may wonder why plane in this safe kind would crash in such a shocking way. According to the NTSB(National Transportation Safety Board), this plane was carrying five mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles, the crash occurred when at least one of the vehicles broke loose and moving very quickly toward the rear end during the takeoff, the key hydraulic systems were damaged and the horizontal stabilizer components failed to make response to the balance change, which made the freighter impossible to take control.

### How Heavy is the MRAP

Mine-Resistant Ambush-Rrotected (MRAP) vehicles are for military use and very heavy comparing with other regular cars. It weights close to 18 tons each. MRAP is designed for protecting the cars from improvised explosive device (IED) attack. A variant of the Humvee’s IED defeating Frag Kit 6 armor were installed on each vehicle, so when it is shifting so quickly in the plane, almost nothing can be done to handle the situation.

### Flight Safety Check’s quote
A lot of times, severe flight accidents were caused not by the quality of the aircraft, but the airline management or  unexpected situation such as this boeing 747 crash.
